# Script Overview

This script simplifies the initialization of projects downloaded from [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/) with
the following features:

- Automatically extracts the `.zip` file generated by Spring Initializr.
- Opens the extracted project in IntelliJ IDEA.
- Replaces the default Maven and Gradle Wrapper mirrors
  with [Alibaba Cloud Mirrors](https://developer.aliyun.com/mirror) by default, ensuring faster access for users in
  regions with limited connectivity to the default mirrors.

---

# Configuration

Before using the script, make sure to complete the following setup:

### Add the Script Directory to the Windows `PATH` Environment Variable

### Configure IntelliJ IDEA Path (Choose One of the Following Options)

1. Create a new environment variable `IDEA_HOME_PATH` and set its value to the IntelliJ IDEA root directory path.
2. Directly Add the `bin` folder of the IntelliJ IDEA installation directory to the Windows `PATH` environment
   variable.

# Usage

### Unzip and Open

After downloading the `.zip` file from [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/), navigate to the same directory as
the zip file and run the following command:

```shell
uao ${Artifact}.zip
```

### Skip Wrapper Mirror Replacement

> Default Behavior: After extraction, the script will replace the default Maven and Gradle Wrapper mirrors
> with [Alibaba Cloud Mirrors](https://developer.aliyun.com/mirror/).

If you prefer to skip this step, include the `skipReplaceWrapper` argument when running the script:

```shell
uao ${Artifact}.zip skipReplaceWrapper
```
